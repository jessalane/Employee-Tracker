  # Employee Tracker

  ## Description
  The following is a node based generator that will populate an employee database. It will automatically prompt you for the necessary fields to populate the tables. Employees with no manager listed will automatically be populated with a null value, meaning the program will recognize them as a manager. When adding a manager to an employee, a list of existing managers will be displayed to choose from. When adding a role to an employee a list of existing roles will also be offered to choose from. You will be given the ability to update managers, roles, and last names for all existing employees.

  ## Installation
  You will need to locally install inquirer, the mysql2 package, and console.table. You will also need to update with the logins to your local host for mysql use. Finally, you will need to naviage your terminal into the sql folder, and source the schema file to create the database and tables.

  ## Usage
  The following is a video showing use in the terminal.
